      "content": "Tangent to a Circle \n\nIn the previous section, you have seen that a tangent* to a circle is a line that intersects the circle at only one point.\n\nTo understand the existence of the tangent to a circle at a point, let us perform the following activities:\nActivity 1 : Take a circular wire and attach a straight wire $A B$ at a point $P$ of the circular wire so that it can rotate about the point $P$ in a plane. Put the system on a table and gently rotate the wire $A B$ about the point $P$ to get different positions of the straight wire [see Fig. 10.3(i)].\n\nIn various positions, the wire intersects the circular wire at P and at another point $\\mathrm{Q}_{1}$ or $\\mathrm{Q}_{2}$ or $\\mathrm{Q}_{3}$, etc. In one position, you will see that it will intersect the circle at the point $P$ only (see position $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} \\mathrm{B}^{\\prime}$ of AB ). This shows that a tangent exists at the point $P$ of the circle. On rotating further, you can observe that in all other positions of $A B$, it will intersect the circle at P and at another point, say $\\mathrm{R}_{1}$ or $R_{2}$ or $R_{3}$, etc. So, you can observe that there is only one tangent at a point of the circle.\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\nFig. 10.3 (i)\n\nWhile doing activity above, you must have observed that as the position AB moves towards the position $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} \\mathrm{B}^{\\prime}$, the common point, say $\\mathrm{Q}_{1}$, of the line AB and the circle gradually comes nearer and nearer to the common point $P$. Ultimately, it coincides with the point P in the position $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} \\mathrm{B}^{\\prime}$ of $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime \\prime} \\mathrm{B}^{\\prime \\prime}$. Again note, what happens if ' $A B$ ' is rotated rightwards about P ? The common point $\\mathrm{R}_{3}$ gradually comes nearer and nearer to P and ultimately coincides with P . So, what we see is:\n\nThe tangent to a circle is a special case of the secant, when the two end points of its corresponding chord coincide.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *The word 'tangent' comes from the Latin word 'tangere', which means to touch and was introduced by the Danish mathematician Thomas Fineke in 1583.\n\nActivity 2 : On a paper, draw a circle and a secant PQ of the circle. Draw various lines parallel to the secant on both sides of it. You will find that after some steps, the length of the chord cut by the lines will gradually decrease, i.e., the two points of intersection of the line and the circle are coming closer and closer [see Fig. 10.3(ii)]. In one case, it becomes zero on one side of the secant and in another case, it becomes zero on the other side of the secant. See the positions $\\mathrm{P}^{\\prime} \\mathrm{Q}^{\\prime}$ and $\\mathrm{P}^{\\prime \\prime} \\mathrm{Q}^{\\prime \\prime}$ of the secant in Fig. 10.3 (ii). These are the tangents to the circle parallel to the given secant PQ. This also helps you to see that there cannot be more than two tangents parallel to a given secant.\n\nThis activity also establishes, what you must have observed, whil\n\n[Content truncated for API limits]",

      "content": "Number of Tangents from a Point on a Circle\n\nTo get an idea of the number of tangents from a point on a circle, let us perform the following activity:\n\nActivity 3 : Draw a circle on a paper. Take a point P inside it. Can you draw a tangent to the circle through this point? You will find that all the lines through this point intersect the circle in two points. So, it is not possible to draw any tangent to a circle through a point inside it [see Fig. 10.6 (i)].\n\nNext take a point P on the circle and draw tangents through this point. You have already observed that there is only one tangent to the circle at such a point [see Fig. 10.6 (ii)].\n\nFinally, take a point P outside the circle and try to draw tangents to the circle from this point. What do you observe? You will find that you can draw exactly two tangents to the circle through this point [see Fig. 10.6 (iii)].\n\nWe can summarise these facts as follows:\nCase 1 : There is no tangent to a circle passing through a point lying inside the circle.\nCase 2 : There is one and only one tangent to a circle passing through a point lying on the circle.\nCase 3 : There are exactly two tangents to a circle through a point lying outside the circle.\n\nIn Fig. 10.6 (iii), $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$ and $\\mathrm{T}_{2}$ are the points of contact of the tangents $\\mathrm{PT}_{1}$ and $\\mathrm{PT}_{2}$ respectively.\n\nThe length of the segment of the tangent from the external point P and the point of contact with the circle is called the length of the tangent\n![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)\n\nFig. 10.6\nfrom the point P to the circle.\n\nNote that in Fig. 10.6 (iii), $\\mathrm{PT}_{1}$ and $\\mathrm{PT}_{2}$ are the lengths of the tangents from P to the circle. The lengths $\\mathrm{PT}_{1}$ and $\\mathrm{PT}_{2}$ have a common property. Can you find this? Measure $\\mathrm{PT}_{1}$ and $\\mathrm{PT}_{2}$. Are these equal? In fact, this is always so. Let us give a proof of this fact in the following theorem.\n\nTheorem 10.2 : The lengths of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal.\nProof : We are given a circle with centre O, a point P lying outside the circle and two tangents PQ, PR on the circle from P (see Fig. 10.7). We are required to prove that $\\mathrm{PQ}=\\mathrm{PR}$.\n\nFor this, we join OP, OQ and OR. Then $\\angle \\mathrm{OQP}$ and $\\angle$ ORP are right angles, because these are angles between the radii and tangents, and according to Theorem 10.1 they are right angles. Now in right triangles OQP and ORP,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{OQ} & =\\mathrm{OR} \\\\\n\\mathrm{OP} & =\\mathrm{OP}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{OQP} \\cong \\Delta$ ORP\nThis gives\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{PQ}=\\mathrm{PR}\n$$\n\n![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)\n\nFig. 10.7\n(Radii of the same circle)\n(Common)\n(RHS)\n(CPCT)\n\n# Remarks \n\n1. The theorem can also be proved by using the Pythagoras Theorem as follows:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{PQ}^{2}=\\mathrm{OP}^{2}-\\mathrm{OQ}^{2}=\\mathrm{OP}^{2}-\\mathrm{OR}^{2}=\\mathrm{PR}^{2}(\\mathrm{As} \\mathrm{OQ}=\\mathrm{OR})\n$$\n\nwhich gives $\\mat\n\n[Content truncated for API limits]",
