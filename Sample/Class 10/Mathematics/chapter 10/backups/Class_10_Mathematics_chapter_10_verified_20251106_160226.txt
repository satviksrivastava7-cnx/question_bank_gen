As these two points of intersection move closer and closer together, the secant approaches a limiting position. When the two points eventually coincide, the secant becomes a tangent, touching the circle at only one point. This transformation can be described using the concept of limits. Imagine a secant rotating about a point on the circle; as the second point of intersection approaches the first, the secant gets closer and closer to becoming a tangent. Visually, this can be represented by a series of secants with decreasing chord lengths, converging to a single line that touches the circle at one point. This limiting behavior is what defines the tangent as a special case of the secant.",

This can be achieved by continuously calculating the tangent line at the current point on the circle and aligning the arm's movement along this tangent. Mathematically, the tangent can be determined by finding the derivative of the circle's equation at the current point. The control mechanism would involve a feedback loop that constantly monitors the arm's position and adjusts its trajectory to stay aligned with the calculated tangent. This requires precise encoders to track the arm's position and a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller to minimize deviations from the desired tangent path. By continuously adjusting the arm's movement based on the tangent, the system can draw precise circles with smooth transitions.",

      "topic": "10.2 Number of Tangents from a Point on a Circle",
      "content": "Number of Tangents from a Point on a Circle\n\nTo get an idea of the number of tangents from a point on a circle, let us perform the following activity:\n\nActivity 3 : Draw a circle on a paper. Take a point P inside it. Can you draw a tangent to the circle through this point? You will find that all the lines through this point intersect the circle in two points. So, it is not possible to draw any tangent to a circle through a point inside it [see Fig. 10.6 (i)].\n\nNext take a point P on the circle and draw tangents through this point. You have already observed that there is only one tangent to the circle at such a point [see Fig. 10.6 (ii)].\n\nFinally, take a point P outside the circle and try to draw tangents to the circle from this point. What do you observe? You will find that you can draw exactly two tangents to the circle through this point [see Fig. 10.6 (iii)].\n\nWe can summarise these facts as follows:\nCase 1 : There is no tangent to a circle passing through a point lying inside the circle.\nCase 2 : There is one and only one tangent to a circle passing through a point lying on the circle.\nCase 3 : There are exactly two tangents to a circle through a point lying outside the circle.\n\nIn Fig. 10.6 (iii), $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$ and $\\mathrm{T}_{2}$ are the points of contact of the tangents $\\mathrm{PT}_{1}$ and $\\mathrm{PT}_{2}$ respectively.\n\nThe length of the segment of the tangent from the external point P and the point of contact with the circle is called the length of the tangent\n![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)\n\nFig. 10.6\nfrom the point P to the circle.\n\nNote that in Fig. 10.6 (iii), $\\mathrm{PT}_{1}$ and $\\mathrm{PT}_{2}$ are the lengths of the tangents from P to the circle. The lengths $\\mathrm{PT}_{1}$ and $\\mathrm{PT}_{2}$ have a common property. Can you find this? Measure $\\mathrm{PT}_{1}$ and $\\mathrm{PT}_{2}$. Are these equal? In fact, this is always so. Let us give a proof of this fact in the following theorem.\n\nTheorem 10.2 : The lengths of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal.\nProof : We are given a circle with centre O, a point P lying outside the circle and two tangents PQ, PR on the circle from P (see Fig. 10.7). We are required to prove that $\\mathrm{PQ}=\\mathrm{PR}$.\n\nFor this, we join OP, OQ and OR. Then $\\angle \\mathrm{OQP}$ and $\\angle$ ORP are right angles, because these are angles between the radii and tangents, and according to Theorem 10.1 they are right angles. Now in right triangles OQP and ORP,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{OQ} & =\\mathrm{OR}\n\\mathrm{OP} & =\\mathrm{OP}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{OQP} \\cong \\Delta$ ORP\nThis gives\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{PQ}=\\mathrm{PR}\n$$\n\n![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)\n\nFig. 10.7\n(Radii of the same circle)\n(Common)\n(RHS)\n(CPCT)\n\n# Remarks \n\n1. The theorem can also be proved by using the Pythagoras Theorem as follows:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{PQ}^{2}=\\mathrm{OP}^{2}-\\mathrm{OQ}^{2}=\\mathrm{OP}^{2}-\\mathrm{OR}^{2}=\\mathrm{PR}^{2}(\\mathrm{As} \\mathrm{OQ}=\\mathrm{OR})\n$$\n\nwhich gives $\\mat",

Tangents to a square, however, are lines that touch the square at a single point, but there is no equivalent theorem stating equal lengths from an external point. The proofs differ significantly because the circle's symmetry allows for congruent triangles, while a square's geometry involves different relationships. The underlying principle is that the curvature and symmetry of the shape dictate the properties of its tangents. A circle's constant curvature leads to predictable tangent behavior, while a square's straight edges and corners result in different tangent properties.",

              "reference_answer": "The angle formed by the two tangents (angle BAC) and the angle subtended by the chord at the center (angle BOC) are supplementary, meaning their sum is 180 degrees. This is because quadrilateral ABOC has angles OBA and OCA as right angles (since tangents are perpendicular to radii). The sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees, so angle BAC + angle BOC + 90 + 90 = 360. Therefore, angle BAC + angle BOC = 180 degrees. This relationship is due to the properties of tangents and the geometry of quadrilaterals.",

The advantage of the RHS proof is its directness. The Pythagorean approach, while valid, is slightly more indirect and requires an extra step of squaring and taking the square root.
