    "short": "A sector of a circle is the region enclosed by two radii and the corresponding arc, while a segment is the region enclosed between a chord and the corresponding arc. The area of a sector with radius $r$ and angle $\\theta$ (in degrees) is given by $\\frac{\\theta}{360} \\times \\pi r^2$, and the length of the arc of this sector is $\\frac{\\theta}{360} \\times 2 \\pi r$. The area of a segment is calculated by subtracting the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord from the area of the corresponding sector. Minor sectors and segments are typically assumed unless otherwise specified.",
    "detailed": "A sector of a circle is the region enclosed by two radii and the corresponding arc, while a segment is the region enclosed between a chord and its corresponding arc. The angle of a sector is the angle formed by the two radii at the center of the circle. A minor sector or segment corresponds to a smaller portion of the circle, while a major sector or segment corresponds to the larger portion.\n\nThe area of a sector of a circle with radius $r$ and central angle $\\theta$ (in degrees) is given by the formula: Area of sector = $\\frac{\\theta}{360} \\times \\pi r^2$. This formula is derived using the unitary method, considering the entire circle as a sector with a $360^{\\circ}$ angle and an area of $\\pi r^2$. Similarly, the length of an arc of a sector with central angle $\\theta$ is given by: Arc length = $\\frac{\\theta}{360} \\times 2 \\pi r$.\n\nThe area of a segment of a circle is calculated by subtracting the area of the triangle formed by the two radii and the chord from the area of the corresponding sector. Thus, Area of segment = Area of sector - Area of triangle. For a major sector or segment, its area can be found by subtracting the area of the minor sector or segment from the total area of the circle ($\\pi r^2$).\n\nFor example, to find the area of a segment, one first calculates the area of the sector using the given radius and central angle. Then, the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord is determined. If the triangle is isosceles with the two equal sides as radii, a perpendicular from the center to the chord bisects the chord and the central angle. Trigonometric ratios can be used to find the lengths of the base and height of the triangle to calculate its area. The area of the segment is then the difference between the sector's area and the triangle's area."
